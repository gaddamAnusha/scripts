why you choose a container? 
container is a volatile and non-persistent and doesn't store the data. we can make the container as a persistent using volume mapping
ex: docker <imagename> -v <postport> <containerport>
diff b/n vm and container? - we can only maintain necessary binaries in containers and vice versa in vm
esxl
kops - multiple kernel 
scheduling of ec2 machines automaticcaly. down the environment in night and up the environment in day time
diff b/n docker and kubernetes?
